# Equation Permuter
Some exploration of equation sets and n-order permutations 


Given a corpus of mathematical equations, solves for every variable when possible.

When second-order equations can be derived, they are computed and offered as methods to a final library.

1. Equation-Set
2. Solutions modulo all free variables
3. Nth-order Combinations
4. Library from equations
